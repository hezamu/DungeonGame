# Dungeon Game

This is a demo app for my talk *Functional and Reactive UIs*. It shows how to apply the functional principles in your business logic, and how to use RxJava Observables to define UI logic as a mapping from the model state to what the user is seeing.

It's built with Scala, RxScala and Scaladin.
